## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to guide users through the installation of ownCloud server, adding users and accessing the ownCloud server via a client application in a short timeframe.  This document is written specifically for installation on an Apple Mac running OSX High Sierra version 10.13.6 or higher.  Please note that this document details an installation for demonstration purposes only.  This method should not be used for a production installation.

## What is ownCloud?
ownCloud allows individual users and enterprise organisations to host their documents within a on-premise, secure cloud infrastructure that is entirely within the owners control.  In terms of architecture, the software utilises a client-server modal, where documents and other software assets are stored on servers and can be accessed through multiple client applications. 

## Installed Prerequisites
In this guide, we are installing the ownCloud server on a virtualbox instance since  this allows a simple and quick installation for demonstration purposes.  Virtualbox version 5.2.26 for OSX is available [here](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.4/VirtualBox-6.0.4-128413-OSX.dmg) 

## Method
# Installation of ownCloud server
First, we need to grab the image to run on virtualBox.  Open [https://owncloud.com/download/](https://owncloud.com/download/) in your browser and download the image via the "DOWNLOAD" button in the "Download ownCloud Server" section.

You will be expected to register with ownCloud at this stage in the process.  Enter your details, making sure that you submit a _valid email address_ (this will be used to send your license to) and also that the Download version that you select is the _ownCloud Server Appliance (VirtualBox)_ version.

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
